Run main2.py for learn and export rl agent

If you are done learning, the game will run on its own with model

And if you want to run your AI-model while progressing in learn, Run test_model.py


You must change FILE_DIRECTORY to your exported AI file directory in model.load

ex) model = PPO.load('./train/best_model_1000000', env)
